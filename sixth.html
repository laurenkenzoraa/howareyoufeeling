Chronic boredom:
Chronic boredom is a common symptom with ADHD, chronic boredom causes people with ADHD to pick up hobbies
very quickly and abandon them very fast. This accompanies that chase effect as well because a new hobby 
can be exciting and fun and can completely take over your mind, but as you do it you realize it wasn't
as much fun as it was supposed to be. This can lead people with ADHD to change hobbies and careers often 
as well as go through different style phases.
