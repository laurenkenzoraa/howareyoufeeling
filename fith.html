Mood swings:
Mood swings happen when your emotions swing one way to another very quickly,
itâ€™s usually brought on by stress or depression but is a common symptom 
for people with ADHD. It's common for people with adhd to get irritated or 
frustrated with people more easily, which can cause a swing in our moods,
but it's also common for people with ADHD to get over stimulated. 
Overstimulation can happen for any reason, everyone has their own triggers
but is most commonly caused by: bright lights, crowded spaces, and 
loudnoises. When these triggers happen it can cause people with ADHD to
become irritable and uncomfortable and maybe lash out.
