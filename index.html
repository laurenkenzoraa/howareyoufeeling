Introduction:
This website is a digital diary over a seven day period in which I tracked my mood 
and productivity alongside my medications. On the left side is my ADHD medication 
and on the right is the medication I take for my anxiety and depression disorder. 
I want this dairy to focus more on the symptoms and problems people face with adhd 
because i find it's not taken as seriously as other disorders and i wanted to bring 
awareness to the hardships people face with ADHD.
