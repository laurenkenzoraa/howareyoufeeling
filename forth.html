Low dopamine:
This is a side effect of ADHD that not many know about, people who are diagnosed 
with ADHD tend to have lower levels of dopamine which leads to a method called the 
“chase effect”. The chase effect is when people with ADHD chase anything to make 
themselves feel better, this could be aggrealine, drugs, or high risk activities. 
“This high-risk genetic trait leads to multiple drug-seeking behaviors, because the 
drugs activate release of dopamine, which can diminish abnormal cravings. Moreover,
this genetic trait is due in part to a form of a gene (DRD2 A1 allele) that prevents 
the expression of the normal laying down of dopamine receptors in brain reward sites
