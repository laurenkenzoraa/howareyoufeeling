Excessive activity or restlessness:
Excessive activity causes people to not be able to sit still, pace, fidget or excessively 
talk for no reason. This is one of the key symptoms in diagnosing ADHD in children, because 
it often causes children to be scolded in professional or educational environments. Modern 
day society isn't designed for people struggling with ADHD so it can be difficult for people 
with ADHD to adapt and function while doing everyday tasks or priorities.
