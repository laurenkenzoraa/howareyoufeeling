Procrastination:
Procrastination is the act of putting off a task or chore until the very last minute
without thinking of the consequence. People with ADHD and other mental illnesses tend 
to do this to relax or reassess priorities, but because of doing this it actually creates
more stress and panic because of having to rush to complete things. Despite knowing this,
people with ADHD tend to do it anyway because it feels good in the moment to push it out of 
their minds, and feel like they have a break even if itâ€™s fake. There are ways to stop procrastination 
habits but it can feel really hard to concur when you suffer from a mental illness.
