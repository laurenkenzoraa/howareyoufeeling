Memory loss:
Short term memory loss is a common symptom of adhd which affects a person's ability 
to remember recent situations surrounding them. Although common in elderly people, short
term memory loss can affect people of any age with ADHD, making it harder to keep organized, 
maintain professional relationships and can affect personal care. This memory loss can be 
depilating and is severely underlooked “Furthermore, highly similar results were reported in 
recent heterogeneity studies reporting that 62%−85% of children with ADHD were classified as i
mpaired in working memory” (Fosco et al., in press; Karalunas et al., 2017; Kofler, Irwin et 
al., 2019).
